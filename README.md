# Multiple-Disease-Preditction
The Multiple Disease Prediction System uses machine learning models like SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest to predict diseases such as Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s based on medical data. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, with future plans for deep learning and web deployment.

This project is a **Multiple Disease Prediction System** that uses Machine Learning to predict the likelihood of various diseases, including:
- **Heart Disease Prediction** (Using Naïve Bayes)
- **Diabetes Prediction**
- **Parkinson’s Disease Prediction**

The model takes patient input data and processes it through trained ML models to provide predictions.

## Features
- **Heart Disease Prediction**: Predicts whether a patient has heart disease based on medical attributes.
- **Diabetes Prediction**: Uses relevant biomarkers to predict diabetes.
- **Parkinson’s Disease Prediction**: Detects Parkinson’s disease using relevant patient parameters.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Naïve Bayes Classifier (for Heart Disease)
- Logistic Regression / SVM / Random Forest (for Diabetes & Parkinson’s)
- Streamlit for the web integration

## Installation & Usage
There were some issues with the project files during the normal method of uploading on Github hence I had to upload the whole project folder as a zip file

Download the zip file and extract it, the main UI could be accessed by the file **`multiple disease pred.py`**.

## Dataset Details
- The dataset includes patient attributes relevant to heart disease, diabetes, and Parkinson’s disease.
- Features include blood pressure, glucose levels, cholesterol, and other medical indicators.

## Model Information
- **Heart Disease Prediction:** Naïve Bayes Classifier
- **Diabetes Prediction:** Logistic Regression / SVM / Random Forest (based on model testing)
- **Parkinson’s Disease Prediction:** Feature selection with ML models
